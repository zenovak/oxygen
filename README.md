## Deployment
Deployment prerequisits. Make sure you have forked, created, or obtained the following:
- A domain name
- A VPS with docker and git installed.
- Tatum.io API keys
- A fork of this repository



Then make sure you setup your `oxygen.env` file. You can do so by copying the example `.env.example` template and fill in the blanks:

```
# Oxygen
WEB_PORT=80
DB_DATA_SOURCE="host=postgres sslmode=disable dbname=oxygen user=oxygen password=oxygen pool_max_conns=32"
SESSION_FS_PATH=/app/sessions

# Random secure string
SESSION_SECRET=<required>

CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://pay.your-site.com
PROCESSING_WEBHOOK_BASE_PATH=https://pay.your-site.com
PROCESSING_PAYMENT_FRONTEND_BASE_PATH=https://pay.your-site.com
KMS_DB_DATA_SOURCE=/app/kms/kms.db

# Specify initial user here
EMAIL_AUTH_USER_EMAIL=<required>

# Random secure string
EMAIL_AUTH_USER_PASSWORD=<required>

# Providers 
TATUM_API_KEY=<required>
TATUM_TEST_API_KEY=<required>
TRONGRID_API_KEY=<required>

# Random secure string
TATUM_HMAC_SECRET=<required>
```



### Postgre database, configurations and emergency access

First connect the postgre database:
```
 psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U oxygen -d oxygen
```
Password is located in docker config. Upon connection you will see the commandline changes to the following:
```
oxygen=#
```

Here are some useful commands:
- Show all tables: `\dt+`
- Exit: \q`
- show a table and its contents: `SELECT * FROM table_name;`


### Updating Tatum subscriptions & URL Webhook links
If you are changing the following fields in oxygen.env:
```
PROCESSING_WEBHOOK_BASE_PATH=https://pay.your-site.com
TATUM_API_KEY=""
TATUM_TEST_API_KEY=""
```

You need to clear the wallet's table of its tatum subscription reference IDs to trigger a resubscription to tatum.

Be sure to first connect to the database!

```
UPDATE wallets
SET tatum_mainnet_subscription_id = NULL, tatum_testnet_subscription_id = NULL;
```


### Updating source code
Since this project uses docker. Every development/source code changes would mean that the project has to be rebuild to create a fresh image

You can use the preconfigured github actions to do this.
1. Create a new Release on github. This will trigger a build action.
2. Pull the new release github package onto docker using:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/zenovak/oxygen:latest
```
3. Run docker compose again to load the new changes:
```
docker compose up -d
```
